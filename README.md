# Health dashboard

A static web page that shows the health of every node of a multi-region system. It is a Blazor WebAssembly
application (.NET 10, standalone): the browser itself calls the health endpoint of every node, so the dashboard needs
no server of its own and shows what a client on the internet sees.

For each environment (tdd, uat, prod) and each deployable in it, the dashboard shows:

- one tile for the Azure Front Door endpoint (the public address) and one tile per regional node (web app), with its
  region and role (primary or standby);
- per tile: the state, the HTTP status, the latency, the app version, the time of the last check and a strip with the
  last 30 checks;
- which region is expected to serve the traffic, a "Failed over to <region>" banner when the primary is not healthy
  but a standby is, and whether the Front Door endpoint agrees;
- in the header: the overall summary ("All 7 nodes healthy", "2 of 7 nodes not healthy"), the time of the last
  refresh, pause and resume, the interval (10 s, 30 s, 60 s) and the probe (health check or liveness).

## Run it locally

```
dotnet run --project src/Dashboard
```

Then open http://localhost:5210. The repository ships a sample `src/Dashboard/wwwroot/topology.json`; its hosts do not
exist, so every tile shows Unreachable. Point the sample at real nodes to see them (and allow
`http://localhost:5210` in their CORS settings, see below).

```
dotnet build -c Release     # warnings are errors
dotnet test -c Release      # the unit tests of the health logic
dotnet publish src/Dashboard -c Release -o publish    # the site is publish/wwwroot
```

The SDK version is pinned in `global.json` (10.0.100, rolling forward to the latest 10.0 feature band).

## The topology: `topology.json`

The dashboard loads `topology.json` from its own address (next to `index.html`) when it starts and when "Reload
topology" is pressed. The deployment writes the real file; the build does not know the system.

```json
{
  "system": { "slug": "cmdemo2", "name": "CM demo 2 multi-region" },
  "generated": "2026-10-04T22:00:00Z",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "uat", "tier": "nonprod",
      "deployables": [
        {
          "name": "ui",
          "frontDoor": "https://cmdemo2-uat-def456.z01.azurefd.net",
          "healthPath": "/_healthcheck", "alivePath": "/alive", "versionPath": "/_version",
          "nodes": [
            { "name": "app-cmdemo2-uat-ui", "region": "westus3", "role": "primary", "url": "https://app-cmdemo2-uat-ui.azurewebsites.net" },
            { "name": "app-cmdemo2-uat-ui-eastus2", "region": "eastus2", "role": "standby", "url": "https://app-cmdemo2-uat-ui-eastus2.azurewebsites.net" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | When it is missing |
|---|---|---|
| `system.slug`, `system.name` | no | The name falls back to the slug, then to "System". |
| `generated` | no | The footer does not show when the topology was generated. |
| `environments` | yes, an array | Error. |
| `environments[].name` | yes | Error. |
| `environments[].tier` | no | No tier label. |
| `environments[].deployables` | no | The environment is shown without tiles. |
| `deployables[].name` | no | `app`. |
| `deployables[].frontDoor` | no, may be `null` | No Front Door tile. A value that is not an absolute http(s) address is an error. |
| `deployables[].healthPath` | no | `/_healthcheck`. |
| `deployables[].alivePath` | no | `/alive`. |
| `deployables[].versionPath` | no | `/_version`. |
| `deployables[].nodes` | no | No node tiles. |
| `nodes[].url` | yes, an absolute http(s) address | Error. |
| `nodes[].name` | no | The host of `url`. |
| `nodes[].region` | no | The tile is titled with the node's name. |
| `nodes[].role` | no | `primary` for the first node of the deployable, `standby` for the others. |

Unknown fields are ignored. A file that is missing, is not JSON or breaks a rule above is not shown in part: the
dashboard shows "The topology could not be read" with every reason and its place in the file (for example
`environments[1].deployables[0].nodes[0].url: missing or not an absolute http or https address.`).

The version endpoint (`versionPath`) answers JSON such as `{"version":"2.4.21+0a1b2c3"}`; the tile shows the part
before `+`. A node that stops answering keeps the last version it reported.

## How the states are decided

Every check is a `GET` from the browser with `cache: no-store` and a timeout of 10 seconds. All nodes are checked at
the same time, and every result is shown as it arrives: a node that hangs delays no other node.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Healthy | The endpoint answered HTTP 200. |
| Unhealthy | The endpoint answered with any other HTTP status (for example 503 from a failing health check). |
| Unreachable | The browser got no answer it may read: a network failure, a refused CORS request or no answer within 10 seconds. |
| Checking | Not checked yet. |

A state is never shown by colour alone: every state has its own icon shape and its text label, and the bars of the
history strip differ in height (tall: healthy, half: unhealthy, stub: unreachable).

**Expected to serve traffic.** Per deployable, the dashboard takes the nodes in priority order (primary nodes first,
then the others, each in the order of the topology) and names the first healthy one. When that node is not a primary,
the deployable has failed over, and the banner says to which region and why. When no node is healthy, nothing can
serve. The Front Door endpoint agrees when it is healthy exactly when a node is; a disagreement is flagged (Front
Door down although a node is healthy, or Front Door healthy although no node is).

**Summary.** Every tile counts as one node: the Front Door endpoints and the web apps. Unhealthy and Unreachable both
count as not healthy.

**Probe.** "Health check" calls `healthPath`: the full check also connects to the database, which keeps a serverless
database awake. "Liveness" calls `alivePath`: it only asks whether the web app is running and leaves the database
alone, so a serverless database can pause while the dashboard is open.

**Polling.** A round of checks runs every interval (30 seconds unless changed). Polling stops while the dashboard is
paused and while its browser tab is hidden (Page Visibility API), and a round runs at once when it resumes or the tab
is shown again. "Check now", changing the probe and reloading the topology run one round at once, also while paused.

## CORS: every node must allow the dashboard's origin

The browser reads an answer from another origin only when that origin allows it. Each node must therefore allow the
dashboard's origin in its CORS settings, on App Service for example:

```
az webapp cors add --resource-group <group> --name <web app> --allowed-origins https://<dashboard host>
```

Without it the browser blocks the answer and the dashboard reports the node as **Unreachable**, although the node may
be healthy: from inside the page, a refused CORS request and a network failure look the same. The same holds for an
answer that does not come from the app, such as the platform's own page for a stopped web app: it carries no CORS
header, so the tile shows Unreachable, not Unhealthy. The browser's console names the cause.

The Front Door endpoint forwards the request to a node, and the node's CORS header comes back through it, so the same
setting covers the Front Door tile.

A node that is not on App Service allows the origin in its own way: an application that runs on infrastructure of its
own answers its health, liveness and version paths with the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` itself, also when the
status is not 200.

## The repository

```
Dashboard.sln
Directory.Build.props        warnings as errors, nullable, analyzers; shared by both projects
global.json                  the SDK
src/Dashboard                the Blazor WebAssembly app
  App.razor                  the page: header, environments, footer, polling
  Components/                tile, history strip, state badge, deployable section
  Health/                    the health logic, plain C# without a browser
  wwwroot/                   index.html, css/app.css, js/visibility.js, the sample topology.json
src/Dashboard.Tests          xUnit tests of the health logic
.github/workflows            build.yml, release.yml, secret-scan.yml
```

The health logic is in `src/Dashboard/Health` and has no dependency on the browser: reading the topology
(`TopologyParser`), classifying an answer (`HealthClassifier`, `NodeProber`), the serving and failover decision
(`ServingAssessment`), the summary (`HealthSummary`), the history (`HistoryBuffer`) and the polling loop (`Poller`).
`HttpClient` and `TimeProvider` are injected, so the tests run them with a stub handler and fake time.

There is no external dependency at run time: no CDN, no web font, no CSS framework. The style sheet is
`wwwroot/css/app.css` and follows the viewer's light or dark preference.

The site is static and expects to be served from the root of its host (`<base href="/">`); the host must serve
`.wasm` files as `application/wasm`.

## Build and release

- **Build** (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): on every pull request and every push to `master`. It builds with
  warnings as errors, runs the tests, publishes the site and uploads the content of the published `wwwroot` folder as
  the artifact `dashboard-site`. The job `Build result` is the check the default-branch ruleset requires.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): after a green Build of `master`. It zips the content of
  `dashboard-site` (`index.html` at the root of the zip) as `<SYSTEM_SLUG>-<DEPLOYABLE_NAME>.<version>.zip`, pushes
  it to the Octopus built-in feed and creates the release `<version>` of the Octopus project
  `<SYSTEM_SLUG>-<DEPLOYABLE_NAME>`. It signs in to Octopus with GitHub OIDC (environment `release`) and reads the
  repository variables `SYSTEM_SLUG`, `DEPLOYABLE_NAME`, `OCTOPUS_URL`, `OCTOPUS_SPACE_NAME` and
  `OCTOPUS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- **secret-scan** (`.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml`): gitleaks over the history of the commit every pull request and push checks out.

The version is `MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION.<run number of the Build run>`; the two numbers are in `build.yml`. The
build passes it as `-p:Version=...`, and the dashboard shows it in its footer. A local build shows `0.0.0-local`.

The zip carries the sample `topology.json`; the deployment replaces it with the real one. The build writes no
precompressed copy of that file (`topology.json.br`, `topology.json.gz`), so no stale copy can be served.
